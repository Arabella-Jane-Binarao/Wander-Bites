                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground chicken</li>
                    <li>1 tbsp chopped fresh dill</li>
                    <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
                    <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon cumin</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                    <li>¼ cup white onion, finely minced</li>
                    <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                    <li>½ teaspoon lemon zest</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup Panko breadcrumbs (plain)</li>
                    <li>1 egg</li>
                    <li>Olive oil for frying (about 2-3 tbsp)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>Add the ground chicken to a large mixing bowl. 
                        Season the chicken with fresh dill, kosher salt, black pepper, 
                        cumin and dried oregano. Mix to incorporate the spices throughout 
                        the meat.</li>
                    <li>Add the minced onion, garlic, lemon zest, egg and breadcrumbs.
                        Stir the meat mixture well, until all ingredients are fully 
                        incorporated.</li>
                    <li>Use a small cookie scoop to scoop 16 meatballs. With clean hands,
                        roll the meatballs into tight balls.</li>
                    <li>Place a large frying pan over medium-high heat on the stovetop. 
                        Add enough olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan with a thin 
                        layer of oil (about 2-3 tablespoons).</li>
                    <li>Carefully place the meatballs in the pan in a single layer, 
                        making sure they are not too crowded. Let the meatballs cook 
                        undisturbed for about 2-3 minutes, until the first side is golden 
                        brown. Continue cooking for another 7-9 minutes, flipping 
                        frequently so that the meatballs cook on all sides.</li>
                    <li>When the meatballs are fully cooked, remove them from the pan
                        with tongs or a slotted spoon and discard the remaining olive oil. 
                        Enjoy!</li>

                <h1>CHIMICHURRI STEAKS</h1>
                <p class="description"> Chimichurri is a tangy and herbaceous sauce that’s traditionally 
                    served with grilled meats. It’s packed with fresh herbs, garlic, tangy lime juice, 
                    and a drizzle of olive oil, making it the perfect companion for a juicy steak.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 Strip Steaks (about 1 inch thick)</li>
                    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                    <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
                    <p>For the Chimichurri Sauce:</p>
                    <li>1 Lime</li>
                    <li>1 cup fresh parsley</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup oregano</li>
                    <li>1 cup cilantro</li>
                    <li>3-4 garlic cloves</li>
                    <li>Salt and Pepper, to taste</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
                    <li>Pat the strip steaks dry with paper towels. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Heat a large oven-safe skillet over medium-high heat. 
                        Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the skillet. Once the oil is hot, 
                        add the steaks to the skillet. Sear the steaks for 2-3 minutes on each side until nicely browned.</li>
                    <li>Carefully transfer the skillet to the preheated oven. 
                        Cook the steaks in the oven for 5-7 minutes for medium-rare, 
                        or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>
                    <li>Remove the skillet from the oven and transfer the steaks to a plate. 
                        Tent the steaks with aluminum foil and let them rest for 5-10 minutes.
                        This allows the juices to redistribute, ensuring a juicy steak.</li>
                    <li>Prepare the Chimichurri Sauce: While the steaks are resting, 
                        prepare the chimichurri sauce. Rinse and dry your fresh herbs 
                        (parsley, oregano, cilantro), pat dry with a paper towel.</li>
                    <li>Strip the parsley, oregano, and cilantro leaves from the stems 
                        and and finely chop the the leaves. 
                        Add the chopped herbs to a small bowl.</li>   
                    <li>Zest and juice the lime over the herbs. Mince the garlic cloves. 
                        Combine the chopped herbs, minced garlic, lime zest, lime juice, 
                        and olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>   
                    <li>Slice and Serve: Once the steaks have rested,
                        slice them against the grain into thick slices. 
                        Serve the steak slices with a generous drizzle of 
                        chimichurri sauce on top.</li>
                    <li>Serve the pan-seared New York strip steaks with chimichurri 
                        sauce alongside your favorite side dishes.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>1 cup sun dried tomatoes</li>
                        <li>1/2 cup shelled walnuts</li>

                        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>

                        <li>2 cups fresh spinach leaves, washed</li>
                        <li>One five-ounce ball of burrata cheese, drained and at room temperature</li>
                    </ul>
                <h2>Instructions</h2>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Soak the sun dried tomatoes in 2 cups boiling water for ten minutes. 
                            Meanwhile, place a large pot of salted water on to boil for the pasta.</li>
                        <li>Place the Parmigiano, walnuts, and garlic cloves in the bowl of a small 
                            food processor and pulse several times to break into crumbs. Drain the 
                            soaked tomatoes, roughly chop half of them, and set them aside 
                            to be added later to the pasta.</li>
                        <li>Add the remaining whole soaked tomatoes to the food processor 
                            along with the tomato paste, red pepper flakes, olive oil, salt, and 
                            black pepper. Process until well-combined and smooth. Taste and add more salt if desired.</li>
                        <li>Cook the pasta according to package directions for al dente.</li>
                        <li>Meanwhile, heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the butter 
                            followed by the prepared red pesto and cook, stirring, 
                            for 2 to 3 minutes or until fragrant and thickened. Add a half cup of 
                            water along with the chopped sun-dried tomatoes and the spinach. 
                            Toss everything together and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, until the spinach 
                            has wilted. Turn the heat down to low and keep warm.</li>
                        <li>Once the pasta has reached al dente, reserve a cup of cooking water 
                            and drain the rest from the pot. Transfer the cooked pasta to 
                            the skillet and toss well with the sauce. Add a splash of pasta 
                            cooking water if the sauce is too thick.
                            Serve topped with burrata and a drizzle of olive oil.
